Introduction/ Background: 
Image this is a cold morning and you get Georgian College at 7:45 but looks there is not a free space
in the parking, class is starting immediately, and you are looking for a free space. Has it happened
to you before? then what was your feeling? Did not you have a wish to know where is a free space for park the car?
The number of commuters is raising in college, but the parking spots are limited. This is a daily
challenging to find a free space in college, and we spend time, energy, and fuel to find a spot,
sometime we have to drive around the college for half an hour, the bad news is: it is going to be worst!

Application Objective: 
In this application, users submit the place that they park their car at and when they are leaving,
submit that space is free. It helps others to find free spaces faster.

This is an Android application, minSdkVersion 21, targetSdkVersion 30.
For releasing in Playstore I changed those to min 22 and max 29 because I had issue with Motorola device.
